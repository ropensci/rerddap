Landings from 1931 through 1968\nwere recovered using funds and services provided by the NESDIS Climate\nDatabase Modernization Program (CDMP). The recovered data, when combined with\nmore recent landings estimates from the California Cooperative Groundfish\nSurvey from 1969 to 2007, forms one of the longest detailed catch records in\nthe US. The 1931-68 period includes monthly summaries of catches by 10-minute\ngeographic blocks.  These data are now openly available to the public for use\nin stock assessments and monitoring of climate effects. Pearson is currently\nworking with the California Department of Fish and Game to extend the\ngeographic summary information to more recent years. Also, the taxa reported\nin the historical data are the \"market categories\" used by fish processors,\nand may involve multiple species groupings. A project has been initiated to\nresolve historical landings to provide best estimates for individual species.\n\nWhen using this data it is critical to understand that a market category is\nNOT a species code - it is a sort group.  While landings in some market\ncategories may consist entirely of the species for which they are named,\nlandings in other market categories may contain few of the species for which\nthey are named.\n\nGeneral Notes:\nThe data from 1930-1932 has a lot of unknown block data.  When the trawl\nlanding data is entered, some of this may be resolved.  At the same time,\nsome gear data will be available.\n\nWhen Source Corp finishes data entry of the landing receipt data, gear code\ndata will be available from 1951-1968; however, this will not be completed\nuntil around 2011.\n\nBlock Maps: https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/PaCOOS/mkt_catch/ca_landings_info.html\nData Source: California Department of Fish & Game.\nData Assembly: NOAA SWFSC FED; Contact: Don.Pearson@noaa.gov\n\ncdm_data_type = Other\nVARIABLES:\nmarket_category\n...

The data itself is originally intended to be used for building decision support tools for farmers and digital agriculture. The first dataset is the historical NDFD / NDGD data distributed by NCEP / NOAA / NWS. The NDFD (National Digital Forecast Database) and NDGD (National Digital Guidance Database) contain gridded forecasts and observations at 2.5km resolution for the Contiguous United States (CONUS). There are also 5km grids for several smaller US regions and non-continguous territories, such as Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico and Alaska. NOAA distributes archives of the NDFD/NDGD via its NOAA Operational Model Archive and Distribution System (NOMADS) in Grib2 format. The data has been converted to ORC to optimize storage space and to, more importantly, simplify data access via standard data analytics tools.\n\nDocumentation: https://datalake.eas.cornell.edu/\nContact: digitalag@cornell.edu\nUpdateFrequency: Hourly\n\ncdm_data_type = Other\nVARIABLES:\nurl\nname (File Name)\nlastModified (Last Modified, seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z)\nsize (bytes)\nfileType (File Type)\n", "", "", "https://upwell.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/info/awsS3Files_cornell_eas_data_lake/index.json", "https://registry.opendata.aws/cornell-eas-data-lake/", "http://upwell.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/rss/awsS3Files_cornell_eas_data_lake.rss", "https://upwell.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/subscriptions/add.html?datasetID=awsS3Files_cornell_eas_data_lake&showErrors=false&email=", "Amazon Web Services", "awsS3Files_cornell_eas_data_lake"],

These data represent a new resource for cell biology, reveal gene expression in poorly characterized cell populations, and allow for direct and controlled comparison of gene expression in cell types shared between tissues, such as T-lymphocytes and endothelial cells from different anatomical locations. Two distinct technical approaches were used for most organs: one approach, microfluidic droplet-based 3\u2019-end counting, enabled the survey of thousands of cells at relatively low coverage, while the other, FACS-based full length transcript analysis, enabled characterization of cell types with high sensitivity and coverage.

The goal of ENCODE is to build a comprehensive parts list of functional elements in the human genome, including elements that act at the protein and RNA levels, and regulatory elements that control cells and circumstances in which a gene is active. ENCODE investigators employ a variety of assays and methods to identify functional elements. The discovery and annotation of gene elements is accomplished primarily by sequencing a diverse range of RNA sources, comparative genomics, integrative bioinformatic methods, and human curation. Regulatory elements are typically investigated through DNA hypersensitivity assays, assays of DNA methylation, and immunoprecipitation (IP) of proteins that interact with DNA and RNA, i.e., modified histones, transcription factors, chromatin regulators, and RNA-binding proteins, followed by sequencing.\n\nDocumentation: https://www.encodeproject.org\nContact: encode-help@lists.stanford.edu\nManagedBy: ENCODE Data Coordinating Center\nUpdateFrequency: Daily\n\ncdm_data_type = Other\nVARIABLES:\nurl\nname (File Name)\nlastModified (Last Modified, seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z)\nsize (bytes)\nfileType (File Type)\n", "", "", "https://upwell.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/info/awsS3Files_encode_public/index.json", "https://registry.opendata.aws/encode-project/", "http://upwell.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/rss/awsS3Files_encode_public.rss", "https://upwell.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/subscriptions/add.html?datasetID=awsS3Files_encode_public&showErrors=false&email=", "Amazon Web Services", "awsS3Files_encode_public"],

It utilizes the best available observation data from satellites and in-situ stations, which are assimilated and processed using ECMWF's Integrated Forecast System (IFS) Cycle 41r2. The dataset provides all essential atmospheric meteorological parameters like, but not limited to, air temperature, pressure and wind at different altitudes, along with surface parameters like rainfall, soil moisture content and sea parameters like sea-surface temperature and wave height. ERA5 provides data at a considerably higher spatial and temporal resolution than its legacy counterpart ERA-Interim. ERA5 consists of high resolution version with 31 km horizontal resolution, and a reduced resolution ensemble version with 10 members. It is currently available since 2008, but will be continuously extended backwards, first until 1979 and then to 1950.

To accomplish this task, microbial community samples were isolated from a cohort of 300 healthy adult human subjects at 18 specific sites within five regions of the body (oral cavity, airways, urogenital track, skin, and gut). Targeted sequencing of the 16S bacterial marker gene and/or whole metagenome shotgun sequencing was performed for thousands of these samples. In addition, whole genome sequences were generated for isolate strains collected from human body sites to act as reference organisms for analysis. Finally, 16S marker and whole metagenome sequencing was also done on additional samples from people suffering from several disease conditions.\n\nDocumentation: https://commonfund.nih.gov/hmp\nContact: https://commonfund.nih.gov/hmp/related_activities\nUpdateFrequency: Uncertain\n\ncdm_data_type = Other\nVARIABLES:\nurl\nname (File Name)\nlastModified (Last Modified, seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z)\nsize (bytes)\nfileType (File Type)\n", "", "", "https://upwell.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/info/awsS3Files_human_microbiome_project/index.json", "https://registry.opendata.aws/human-microbiome-project/", "http://upwell.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/rss/awsS3Files_human_microbiome_project.rss", "https://upwell.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/subscriptions/add.html?datasetID=awsS3Files_human_microbiome_project&showErrors=false&email=", "Amazon Web Services", "awsS3Files_human_microbiome_project"],

With global coverage, GEFS is produced four times a day with weather forecasts going out to 16 days.\n\nDocumentation: https://docs.opendata.aws/noaa-gefs-pds/readme.html\nContact: For questions regarding data content or quality, visit [the NOAA GEFS site](http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/index.php?branch=GEFS).

It is operated by NOAA\u2019s Office of Water Prediction. This bucket contains a four-week rollover of the Short Range Forecast model output and the corresponding forcing data for the model. The model is forced with meteorological data from the High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) and the Rapid Refresh (RAP) models.

These simulations used observed rainfall as input and ingested other required meteorological input fields from a weather reanalysis dataset. The output frequency and fields available in this historical NWM dataset differ from those contained in the real-time forecast model. One application of this dataset is to provide historical context to current real-time streamflow, soil moisture and snowpack NWM conditions. The reanalysis data can be used to infer flow frequencies and perform temporal analyses with hourly streamflow output and 3-hourly land surface output.

The MOCNESS-1 has nine rectangular nets (1m x 1.4 m) which are opened and closed sequentially by commands through conducting cable from the surface (Wiebe et al., 1976). In MOCNESS systems, \"the underwater unit sends a data frame, comprised of temperature, depth, conductivity, net-frame angle, flow count, time, number of open net, and net opening/closing, to the deck unit in a compressed hexadecimal format every 2 seconds and from the deck unit to a microcomputer every 4 seconds... Temperature (to approximately 0.01 deg C) and conductivity are measured with SEABIRD sensors. Normally, a modified T.S.K.-flowmeter is used... Both the temperature and conductivity sensors and the flowmeter are mounted on top of the frame so that they face horizontally when the frame is at a towing angle of 45deg... Calculations of salinity (to approximately 0.01 o/oo S), potential temperature (theta), potential density (sigma), the oblique and vertical velocities of the net, and the approximate volume filtered by each net are made after each string of data has been received by the computer.\" (Wiebe et al., 1985) In addition, depending on the particular configuration of the MOCNESS-1, data may have been collected from other sensors attached to the frame : (Transmissometer, Fluorometer, Downwelling light sensor, and the Oxygen sensor). A SeaBird underwater pump was also included in the sensor suit e.\nAfter retrieval to deck, the contents of the nets were rinsed into the codends a nd transferred to storage bottles, and fixed and preserved with formalin. In the shore laboratory, the contents of the bottles were subsampled and counts and biomass estimates made for selected taxa (see the Proc_Protocol info below).

Continuous surveys of seabirds were conducted simultaneously in June (onset of upwelling) and August (mature phase of upwelling).\n\nSeabird surveys were conducted continuously during daylight, using a 300-m-wide transect strip. Within that strip, birds were counted that occurred within the 90 degree quadrant off the ship's bow that offered the best observation conditions.\n\nObserved counts of seabirds recorded as flying in a steady direction were adjusted for the effect of flight speed and direction relative to that of the ship (Spear et al., 1992; Spear and Ainley, 1997b). The effect of such flux is the most serious bias encountered during seabird surveys at sea (Spear et al., 2005). Known as random directional movement (as opposed to nonrandom directional movement, which occurs when birds are attracted or repelled from the survey vessel), this problem usually results in density overestimation because most species fly faster than survey vessels; densities of birds that fly slower or at a similar speed as the survey vessel (e.g., storm-petrels), or are flying in the same direction, are usually underestimated (Spear et al., 1992)\n\n(extracted from: David G.

The State of Hawaii Department of Health (HIDOH) Clean Water Branch (CWB) monitors the waters of Hawaii's beaches for concentrations of Enterococcus, which acts as an indicator of pathogens. The CWB also uses Clostridium perfringens as a secondary tracer of sewage contamination. Results of this monitoring are evaluated using a decision rule to determine whether a beach is safe (\"Compliant\") or not safe (on \"Alert\") for swimming and other water contact activities. If a beach is found to be on \"Alert\" due to elevated indicator bacteria levels, the CWB issues public warnings and alerts and determines whether resampling of the area is necessary.\n\nUnder the U.S. BEACH Act, the State of Hawaii receives an annual grant to implement its beach monitoring program. This requires the State to conduct a monitoring and notification program that is consistent with performance criteria published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2002. In March 2010, the EPA approved amendments to the Hawaii Administrative Rules (HAR), Chapter 11-54, Water Quality Standards (CWB QAPrgP, HIDOH 2011, Appendix D), which revised the previous State Enterococcus criteria of a geometric mean (GM) of 7 colony-forming units (CFU) per 100 mL and a single sample maximum (SSM) of 100 CFU/100 mL to meet current EPA guidelines. The State of Hawaii now uses the EPA recommended Enterococcus GM and SSM for recreational waters consistent in the 1986 Ambient Water Quality Criteria for Bacteria. The criterion lists the GM and SSM for marine waters as 35 CFU/100 mL and 104 CFU/100 mL, respectively.\n\nThe CWB utilizes Clostridium perfringens as a secondary tracer in addition to the Enterococcus indicator to help distinguish between sewage and non-sewage sources of elevated Enterococcus levels in marine coastal waters. The reliability of Enterococcus as an indicator organism in tropical environments has been questioned. This issue was formally documented in the report, Tropical Water Quality Indicator Workshop (Fujioka and Byappanahalli, 2003).\n\nOne of the limitations of all available and EPA-approved test methods is that the sample must be incubated for about 24 hours. As a result, the public finds out today when they shouldn't have gone in the water yesterday. As a result, warning signs on the beach may or may not be reflective of actual water quality because they are based on tests performed one or more days ago.\n\nBeach Monitoring Quality Assurance Project Plan (CWBMONQAPP002):\nhttps://www.pacioos.hawaii.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Beach_Monitoring_QAPP_CWBMONQAPP002_120507.pdf\n\ncdm_data_type = Point\nVARIABLES:\ntime (seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z)\n...

This community-based monitoring effort provided valuable data for resource management purposes. Informed volunteer networks can serve as a community's \"eyes and ears\" and will often provide the first indications of changes to a system. In addition to the value of early detection, it is important to maintain ongoing monitoring efforts to compile data and document resource conditions.\n\nIn addition to water temperature, salinity, turbidity (water clarity), and pH, sampling sites were also monitored for harmful bacteria levels of Enterococcus through 2014-06-26. This indicator bacteria has been correlated with the presence of human pathogens (disease-causing organisms) and therefore with human illnesses such as gastroenteritis, diarrhea, and various infections in epidemiological studies. As such, it is commonly measured in beach water quality monitoring programs. For reference, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 1986 Ambient Water Quality Criteria for Bacteria recommends that a water quality alert is posted if either: (a.) the latest water sample exceeds 104 CFU/100 mL of Enterococcus, or (b.) the geometric mean of the past 30 days of water samples exceeds 35 CFU/100 mL. One of the limitations of all available and EPA-approved test methods is that the sample must be incubated for about 24 hours.\n\nData were managed through an online repository, the Coral Reef Monitoring Data Portal (now defunct), developed and coordinated by the Coral Reef Alliance (CORAL) and its partners with funding provided by the Hawaii Tourism Authority (HTA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Data collection was coordinated by the Hawaii Division of Aquatic Resources (DAR), the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary (HIHWNMS), Aquanimity Now, the Digital Bus, Save Honolua Coalition, Project S.E.A.-Link, and other local organizations and agencies.

NDBC's moored buoys measure and transmit\nbarometric pressure; wind direction, speed, and gust; air and sea\ntemperature; and wave energy spectra from which significant wave height,\ndominant wave period, and average wave period are derived. Even the\ndirection of wave propagation is measured on many moored buoys. See\nhttps://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/measdes.shtml for a description of the measurements.\n\nThe source data from NOAA NDBC has different column names, different units,\nand different missing values in different files, and other problems\n(notably, lots of rows with duplicate or different values for the same time\npoint).

In this dataset, 'Z' indicates 'good' data. \nThe '.'s say to match any character.  \nThe '*' says to match the previous character 0 or more times.  \nSee the tutorial for regular expressions at\nhttps://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaRegularExpressions/article.html\n\ncdm_data_type = Point\nVARIABLES:\ncruise_id\nexpocode\nfacility\nID\nIMO\nplatform\nplatform_version\nsite\ntime (seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z)\nlatitude (degrees_north)\nlongitude (degrees_east)\nairPressure (Atmospheric Pressure, millibar)\n...

For example, to extract just data where time (qcindex=1), latitude (qcindex=2), longitude (qcindex=3), and airTemperature (qcindex=12) are 'good' data, include this constraint in your ERDDAP query:\n flag=~\"ZZZ........Z.*\"\nin your query.\n'=~' indicates this is a regular expression constraint.\nThe 'Z's are literal characters.  In this dataset, 'Z' indicates 'good' data.\nThe '.'s say to match any character.\nThe '*' says to match the previous character 0 or more times.\n(Don't include backslashes in your query.)\nSee the tutorial for regular expressions at\nhttps://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaRegularExpressions/article.html\n\ncdm_data_type = Point\nVARIABLES:\ncruise_id\nexpocode\nfacility\nID\nIMO\nplatform\nplatform_version\nsite\ntime (seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z)\nlatitude (degrees_north)\nlongitude (degrees_east)\n...
