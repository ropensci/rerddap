The sources of data are satellite (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)) and in situ platforms (i.e., ships and buoys), and the specific datasets employed may change over time. At the marginal ice zone, sea ice concentrations are used to generate proxy SSTs.  A preliminary version of this file is produced in near-real time (1-day latency), and then replaced with a final version after 2 weeks.

Landings from 1931 through 1968\nwere recovered using funds and services provided by the NESDIS Climate\nDatabase Modernization Program (CDMP). The recovered data, when combined with\nmore recent landings estimates from the California Cooperative Groundfish\nSurvey from 1969 to 2007, forms one of the longest detailed catch records in\nthe US. The 1931-68 period includes monthly summaries of catches by 10-minute\ngeographic blocks.  These data are now openly available to the public for use\nin stock assessments and monitoring of climate effects. Pearson is currently\nworking with the California Department of Fish and Game to extend the\ngeographic summary information to more recent years. Also, the taxa reported\nin the historical data are the \"market categories\" used by fish processors,\nand may involve multiple species groupings. A project has been initiated to\nresolve historical landings to provide best estimates for individual species.\n\nWhen using this data it is critical to understand that a market category is\nNOT a species code - it is a sort group.  While landings in some market\ncategories may consist entirely of the species for which they are named,\nlandings in other market categories may contain few of the species for which\nthey are named.\n\nGeneral Notes:\nThe data from 1930-1932 has a lot of unknown block data.  When the trawl\nlanding data is entered, some of this may be resolved.  At the same time,\nsome gear data will be available.\n\nWhen Source Corp finishes data entry of the landing receipt data, gear code\ndata will be available from 1951-1968; however, this will not be completed\nuntil around 2011.\n\nBlock Maps: https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/PaCOOS/mkt_catch/ca_landings_info.html\nData Source: California Department of Fish & Game.\nData Assembly: NOAA SWFSC FED; Contact: Don.Pearson@noaa.gov\n\ncdm_data_type = Other\nVARIABLES:\nmarket_category\n...

The MOCNESS-1 has nine rectangular nets (1m x 1.4 m) which are opened and closed sequentially by commands through conducting cable from the surface (Wiebe et al., 1976). In MOCNESS systems, \"the underwater unit sends a data frame, comprised of temperature, depth, conductivity, net-frame angle, flow count, time, number of open net, and net opening/closing, to the deck unit in a compressed hexadecimal format every 2 seconds and from the deck unit to a microcomputer every 4 seconds... Temperature (to approximately 0.01 deg C) and conductivity are measured with SEABIRD sensors. Normally, a modified T.S.K.-flowmeter is used... Both the temperature and conductivity sensors and the flowmeter are mounted on top of the frame so that they face horizontally when the frame is at a towing angle of 45deg... Calculations of salinity (to approximately 0.01 o/oo S), potential temperature (theta), potential density (sigma), the oblique and vertical velocities of the net, and the approximate volume filtered by each net are made after each string of data has been received by the computer.\" (Wiebe et al., 1985) In addition, depending on the particular configuration of the MOCNESS-1, data may have been collected from other sensors attached to the frame : (Transmissometer, Fluorometer, Downwelling light sensor, and the Oxygen sensor). A SeaBird underwater pump was also included in the sensor suit e.\nAfter retrieval to deck, the contents of the nets were rinsed into the codends a nd transferred to storage bottles, and fixed and preserved with formalin.

Continuous surveys of seabirds were conducted simultaneously in June (onset of upwelling) and August (mature phase of upwelling).\n\nSeabird surveys were conducted continuously during daylight, using a 300-m-wide transect strip. Within that strip, birds were counted that occurred within the 90 degree quadrant off the ship's bow that offered the best observation conditions.\n\nObserved counts of seabirds recorded as flying in a steady direction were adjusted for the effect of flight speed and direction relative to that of the ship (Spear et al., 1992; Spear and Ainley, 1997b). The effect of such flux is the most serious bias encountered during seabird surveys at sea (Spear et al., 2005). Known as random directional movement (as opposed to nonrandom directional movement, which occurs when birds are attracted or repelled from the survey vessel), this problem usually results in density overestimation because most species fly faster than survey vessels; densities of birds that fly slower or at a similar speed as the survey vessel (e.g., storm-petrels), or are flying in the same direction, are usually underestimated (Spear et al., 1992)\n\n(extracted from: David G.

These events have proven difficult to study outside of the time series station ALOHA at Hawai'i.\n\ncdm_data_type = Trajectory\nVARIABLES:\nvehicleName (Vehicle Name)\nweather\nfeed_version\ntime (Datetime, seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z)\nlatitude (degrees_north)\nlongitude (degrees_east)\ntemperature (degree_C)\npressure (mBar)\navg_wind_speed (Wind Speed, knots)\nstd_dev_wind_speed (Wind Speed, knots)\navg_wind_direction (Wind From Direction, degrees_true)\nstd_dev_wind_direction (Wind From Direction, degrees_true)\n", "https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/metadata/fgdc/xml/LiquidR_HBG3_2015_weather_fgdc.xml", "https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/metadata/iso19115/xml/LiquidR_HBG3_2015_weather_iso19115.xml", "https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/info/LiquidR_HBG3_2015_weather/index.json", "https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/MAGI/", "http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/rss/LiquidR_HBG3_2015_weather.rss", "https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/subscriptions/add.html?datasetID=LiquidR_HBG3_2015_weather&showErrors=false&email=", "Liquid Robotics, UT Austin, NOAA NMFS SWFSC ERD", "LiquidR_HBG3_2015_weather"],

Moored buoys are the weather\nsentinels of the sea. They are deployed in the coastal and offshore waters\nfrom the western Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean around Hawaii, and from the\nBering Sea to the South Pacific. NDBC's moored buoys measure and transmit\nbarometric pressure; wind direction, speed, and gust; air and sea\ntemperature; and wave energy spectra from which significant wave height,\ndominant wave period, and average wave period are derived. Even the\ndirection of wave propagation is measured on many moored buoys. See\nhttps://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/measdes.shtml for a description of the measurements.\n\nThe source data from NOAA NDBC has different column names, different units,\nand different missing values in different files, and other problems\n(notably, lots of rows with duplicate or different values for the same time\npoint). This dataset is a standardized, reformatted, and lightly edited\nversion of that source data, created by NOAA NMFS SWFSC ERD (email:\nerd.data at noaa.gov). Before 2020-01-29, this dataset only had the data\nthat was closest to a given hour, rounded to the nearest hour. Now, this\ndataset has all of the data available from NDBC with the original time\nvalues. If there are multiple source rows for a given buoy for a given\ntime, only the row with the most non-NaN data values is kept. If there is\na gap in the data, a row of missing values is inserted (which causes a nice\ngap when the data is graphed).

In 2004 the survey area was expanded to cover the \nentire coast from San Diego to Cape Mendocino.  The survey samples a series \nof fixed trawl stations using a midwater trawl. The midwater trawl survey \ngear captures significant numbers of approximately 10 rockfish species during\ntheir pelagic juvenile stage (i.e., 50-150 days old), by which time annual\nreproductive success has been established. Catch-per-unit-effort data from\nthe survey are analyzed and serve as the basis for predicting future \nrecruitment to rockfish fisheries.

NOAAs 1/4-degree Daily Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) (sometimes referred to as Reynolds SST, which however also refers to earlier products at different resolution), currently available as version v02r01, is created by interpolating and extrapolating SST observations from different sources, resulting in a smoothed complete field. The sources of data are satellite (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)) and in situ platforms (i.e., ships and buoys), and the specific datasets employed may change over time.

Pearson is currently\nworking with the California Department of Fish and Game to extend the\ngeographic summary information to more recent years. Also, the taxa reported\nin the historical data are the \"market categories\" used by fish processors,\nand may involve multiple species groupings. A project has been initiated to\nresolve historical landings to provide best estimates for individual species.\n\nWhen using this data it is critical to understand that a market category is\nNOT a species code - it is a sort group.  While landings in some market\ncategories may consist entirely of the species for which they are named,\nlandings in other market categories may contain few of the species for which\nthey are named.\n\nGeneral Notes:\nThe data from 1930-1932 has a lot of unknown block data.  When the trawl\nlanding data is entered, some of this may be resolved.  At the same time,\nsome gear data will be available.\n\nWhen Source Corp finishes data entry of the landing receipt data, gear code\ndata will be available from 1951-1968; however, this will not be completed\nuntil around 2011.\n\nBlock Maps: https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/PaCOOS/mkt_catch/ca_landings_info.html\nData Source: California Department of Fish & Game.\nData Assembly: NOAA SWFSC FED; Contact: Don.Pearson@noaa.gov\n\ncdm_data_type = Other\nVARIABLES:\nmarket_category\n...

The MOCNESS-1 has nine rectangular nets (1m x 1.4 m) which are opened and closed sequentially by commands through conducting cable from the surface (Wiebe et al., 1976). In MOCNESS systems, \"the underwater unit sends a data frame, comprised of temperature, depth, conductivity, net-frame angle, flow count, time, number of open net, and net opening/closing, to the deck unit in a compressed hexadecimal format every 2 seconds and from the deck unit to a microcomputer every 4 seconds... Temperature (to approximately 0.01 deg C) and conductivity are measured with SEABIRD sensors. Normally, a modified T.S.K.-flowmeter is used... Both the temperature and conductivity sensors and the flowmeter are mounted on top of the frame so that they face horizontally when the frame is at a towing angle of 45deg... Calculations of salinity (to approximately 0.01 o/oo S), potential temperature (theta), potential density (sigma), the oblique and vertical velocities of the net, and the approximate volume filtered by each net are made after each string of data has been received by the computer.\" (Wiebe et al., 1985) In addition, depending on the particular configuration of the MOCNESS-1, data may have been collected from other sensors attached to the frame : (Transmissometer, Fluorometer, Downwelling light sensor, and the Oxygen sensor).

Continuous surveys of seabirds were conducted simultaneously in June (onset of upwelling) and August (mature phase of upwelling).\n\nSeabird surveys were conducted continuously during daylight, using a 300-m-wide transect strip. Within that strip, birds were counted that occurred within the 90 degree quadrant off the ship's bow that offered the best observation conditions.\n\nObserved counts of seabirds recorded as flying in a steady direction were adjusted for the effect of flight speed and direction relative to that of the ship (Spear et al., 1992; Spear and Ainley, 1997b). The effect of such flux is the most serious bias encountered during seabird surveys at sea (Spear et al., 2005). Known as random directional movement (as opposed to nonrandom directional movement, which occurs when birds are attracted or repelled from the survey vessel), this problem usually results in density overestimation because most species fly faster than survey vessels; densities of birds that fly slower or at a similar speed as the survey vessel (e.g., storm-petrels), or are flying in the same direction, are usually underestimated (Spear et al., 1992)\n\n(extracted from: David G.

Surveys were conducted across the shelf and slope off Oregon and northern California (41.9 - 44.65N) from the coast to ~125.5W.   Surveys were conducted in passing mode while the R/V New Horizon was in transit between stations for hydrographic and zooplankton sampling.   Observations were conducted from the flying bridge during daylight (~0600 to 2030) whenever sufficient visibility (i.e., > 2 nm) and weather (i.e., < Beaufort 6) allowed.   Two observers simultaneously surveyed to the horizon with 25 x 150 binoculars, equipped with compass and reticle.   Each observer surveyed a 100 degree arc from 10 degrees off the bow (opposite side) to 90 degrees on their side of the ship.   A third observer focused on the track-line by eye, aided with 7 x 50 hand-held binoculars.   Sightings were entered immediately on a laptop computer connected to the ship's GPS system.   Positions of all sightings were corrected to reflect the actual location of the cetaceans, rather than the ship's position.   The height from the surface of the water to the eyes of observers on the 25 x 150 binoculars was 10.87 m.\n\nFor more information, see:\nhttp://cis.whoi.edu/science/bcodmo/dataset.cfm?id=10055&flag=view\nor\nhttp://globec.whoi.edu/jg/info/globec/nep/ccs/cetaceans%7Bdir=globec.whoi.edu/jg/dir/globec/nep/ccs/,data=globec.whoi.edu/jg/serv/globec/nep/ccs/cetaceans.html0%7D\n\nContact PIs:\nCynthia T.

Moored buoys are the weather\nsentinels of the sea. They are deployed in the coastal and offshore waters\nfrom the western Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean around Hawaii, and from the\nBering Sea to the South Pacific. NDBC's moored buoys measure and transmit\nbarometric pressure; wind direction, speed, and gust; air and sea\ntemperature; and wave energy spectra from which significant wave height,\ndominant wave period, and average wave period are derived. Even the\ndirection of wave propagation is measured on many moored buoys. See\nhttps://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/measdes.shtml for a description of the measurements.\n\nThe source data from NOAA NDBC has different column names, different units,\nand different missing values in different files, and other problems\n(notably, lots of rows with duplicate or different values for the same time\npoint).
