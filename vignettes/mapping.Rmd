## Getting started with `plotdap()`

The `plotdap()` function makes it easy to visualize data acquired via `tabledap()` or `griddap()`. Regardless of the data you want to visualize, you'll always want to start a plot via `plotdap()`, where you may specify some "global" plotting options. Subsequent sections will demonstrate how to add tables/grids via `add_tabledap()`/`add_griddap()`, but for now we'll focus on options provided by `plotdap()`. Most importantly, the first argument decides whether [base](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/graphics/html/plot.html) or [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggplot2) graphics should be used for the actual plotting.

```{r world, fig.align='default'}
library(rerddap)
plotdap()
plotdap("base")
```

In addition to choosing a plotting method, `plotdap()` is where you can define properties of the background map, including the target projection using a valid coordinate reference system (CRS) defintion. Projection is performed using the [PROJ.4 library](http://proj4.org/), and [spatialreference.org](http://www.spatialreference.org) is a great resource for finding PROJ.4 CRS descriptions. Using the search utility, you can for example, [search for "South Pole"](http://spatialreference.org/ref/sr-org/?search=South+Pole&srtext=Search) and pick from a number of options. Here I've chosen the [MODIS South Pole Stereographic](http://spatialreference.org/ref/sr-org/8375/) option and copy-pasted the [Proj4 page](http://spatialreference.org/ref/sr-org/8375/proj4/) with the CRS definition: 

```{r southPole, fig.width=7}
plotdap("base",
  mapTitle = "MODIS South Pole Stereographic", 
  mapFill = "transparent", 
  mapColor = "steelblue",
  crs = "+proj=stere +lat_0=-90 +lat_ts=-90 +lon_0=-63 +k=1 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs"
)
```

You might notice that some projections aren't "well-defined" on a global scale, and thus, may result in an error, or a "broken" looking map. For instance, [this Albers projection centered on Alaska](http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/3467/):

```{r alaska, eval = FALSE}
alaska <- "+proj=aea +lat_1=55 +lat_2=65 +lat_0=50 +lon_0=-154 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs"
plotdap("base", crs = alaska)
```

```r
#> Error code: 6
#> Error in CPL_transform(x, crs$proj4string, crs$epsg) : OGR error
```

That does not mean we can't use this (or similar) projections -- we just have to be careful that they are sensible given the lat/lon limits. By default, those limits span the entire world, but as we'll see later, the limits are shrunk to the given data (i.e., `griddap()` / `tabledap()`) limits. In other words, we should expect this projection to work once we "add" some data located near Alaska to the visualization. However, in case you want to make a map without any data, or want to customize the background map in some special way, you can supply an [**sf**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sf) object (or something coercable to an **sf** object) to the `mapData` argument.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
alaska <- "+proj=aea +lat_1=55 +lat_2=65 +lat_0=50 +lon_0=-154 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs"
```

```{r}
library(sf)
library(mapdata)
w <- st_as_sf(maps::map("world", plot = FALSE, fill = TRUE))
us <- st_transform(subset(w, ID == "USA"), alaska)
plotdap(mapData = us)
```

With the odd exception of window sizing and projections, the options in `plotdap()` should *just work* in a similar way for either plotting method. However, there are some useful options that are deliberately left out, since they work differently based on the plotting method.   

Since the result of `plotdap()` is always a map, it always forces a fixed aspect ratio (i.e., $\frac{height}{width}$ of graph equals $r=\frac{latitude}{longitude}$). For this reason, the current size of your graphics device may not be sensible for the value of $r$ (for instance, if $r$ is high, but the height of the graphics device is small, you may see an error such as: `polygon edge not found` since the device cannot possibly render the result under the conditions). For a number of reasons, `plotdap()` will not automatically resize your graphics device; instead, it's recommended that you use a reliable graphics device such as Cairo, and use a height/width ratio close to $r$.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# write plot to disk using the Cairo package
library(Cairo)
# (latitude limits) / (longitude limits)
r <- 85 / 120
CairoPNG("myPlot.png", height = 400 * r, width = 400, res = 96)
# alter default margins for base plotting (leaving just enough space for a title)
par(mar = c(0, 0, 1, 0))
plotdap("base", mapData = us, mapTitle = "Albers projection of Alaska")
dev.off()
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.height = 280, out.width = 400}
knitr::include_graphics("myPlot.png")
```

More advanced users that know some base/ggplot2 plotting may want more control of certain aspects of the plot (a later section -- Customizing `plotdap()` objects -- covers this topic). 

## Adding `tabledap()` layers

The `add_tabledap()` function allows you to add markers that encode variable(s) obtained via `tabledap()` to an existing `plotdap()` object. For example, suppose we have the following `sardines` data, and wish to understand the frequency of subsample counts:

```{r}
sardines <- tabledap(
  'FRDCPSTrawlLHHaulCatch',
  fields = c('latitude',  'longitude', 'time', 'scientific_name', 'subsample_count'),
  'time>=2010-01-01', 'time<=2012-01-01', 'scientific_name="Sardinops sagax"'
)
sardines
```

At the very least, `add_tabledap()` needs a base map (i.e., a `plotdap()` object), the `tabledap()` data, and a *formula* defining the variable of interest (for encoding the color of the markers). In R, you can create a formula by prefixing `~` to some expression. This formula can simply reference a variable already residing in the dataset (e.g., `~subsample_count`) or it can be a function of some variables (e.g. `~log2(subsample_count)`):

```{r, fig.align='default'}
add_tabledap(
  plotdap(), 
  sardines, 
  ~subsample_count
)
add_tabledap(
  plotdap(crs = "+proj=robin", mapTitle = "Log subsample count"), 
  sardines, 
  ~log2(subsample_count)
)
```

Since `time` is an important variable in many `tabledap()` objects, `add_tabledap()` also has a `animate` argument which allows you to easily animate over the `time` variable. It is also easy to alter the color scale and symbol type via the `color` and `shape` arguments. For details about these arguments, please refer to the documentation on `help(add_tabledap)`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
add_tabledap(
  plotdap(crs = "+proj=robin"), 
  sardines, 
  ~subsample_count, 
  color = "density", 
  shape = 4, 
  animate = TRUE
)
```

## Adding `griddap()` layers

Similar to `add_tabledap()`, the `add_griddap()` function makes it easy to add rasters (i.e., rectangular tiles) to a `plotdap()` object. To demonstrate, lets obtain some of the latest sea surface temperatures along the western coast of the US.

```{r}
murSST <- griddap(
  'jplMURSST41', latitude = c(22, 51), longitude = c(-140, -105),
  time = c('last', 'last'), fields = 'analysed_sst'
)
murSST
```

Again, similar to `add_tabledap()`, `add_griddap()` needs a base map (i.e., a `plotdap()` object), the `griddap()` data, and a *formula* defining the variable of interest (for encoding the fill of the rectangles). The `add_griddap()` function also has a `maxpixels` argument which sets a maximum threshold for the number of cells (i.e., pixels) to use before projection and plotting occurs. Compared to ggplot2, base plotting is much more efficient at rendering raster objects, so it might be worth increasing the threshold in that case:

```{r}
# reduce the number of trailing digits in the legend
options(digits = 2)
add_griddap(
  plotdap("base", crs = "+proj=robin"), 
  murSST, ~analysed_sst, maxpixels = 50000
)
```

The `murSST` grid has a single time point (i.e., `length(unique(murSST$data$time)) == 1`), but what do we do when there are multiple time points? In addition to animating multiple grids (a la `add_tabledap()`), you also have the option to summarize multiple grids into a single grid. To demonstrate, lets grab some wind speeds measured along the west coast of the US.

```{r}
wind <- griddap(
  'erdQMwindmday', time = c('2016-11-16', '2017-01-16'),
  latitude = c(30, 50), longitude = c(210, 240),
  fields = 'x_wind'
)
unique(wind$data$time)
```

When faced with multiple time periods, and `animate = FALSE` (the default), the `time` argument is used to reduce multiple grids (i.e., raster bricks) to a single grid (i.e., a single raster layer). You can pass any R function to the `time` argument, but when `animate = FALSE`, you should take care to ensure the function returns a single value. The default uses the `mean()` function so that each cell represents the average (in this case amongst three time points), but we could easily set this to `var()` to get the variance for each cell:

```{r, fig.align='default'}
add_griddap(
  plotdap("base", crs = alaska, mapTitle = "Mean wind speed"), 
  wind, ~x_wind
)
add_griddap(
  plotdap("base", crs = alaska, mapTitle = "Variance of wind speed"), 
  wind, ~x_wind, time = var
)
```

If you just want to animate the raw grid values over time (instead of computing summary statistic(s) for each cell), you can set `time` to the `identity` function, then set `animate = TRUE`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
add_griddap(
  plotdap(crs = "+proj=robin"), 
  wind, ~x_wind, 
  time = identity, 
  animate = TRUE
)
```

  </a>
</div>


## Combining tables/grids

The `plotdap()` interface is designed so that you can plot both tables and grids at once (although I don't recommend trying to plot more than one `griddap()` or `tabledap()` object at once). It's also designed to work well with the `%>%` operator from the **magrittr** package so that code can be expressed in a left-to-right (rather than inside-out) fashion:

```{r}
plotdap("base") %>%
  add_griddap(murSST, ~analysed_sst) %>%
  add_tabledap(sardines, ~subsample_count)
```

## Modifying `ggplotdap` objects

By this point, you might have noticed some subtle differences in the defaults of `plotdap("ggplot2")` versus `plotdap("base")`. The default base version is left intentially minimal as it is often much harder (or impossible) to modify/remove elements from a base graphic once it's drawn. However, this is fairly easy using the **ggplot2** approach (assuming you know a bit of **ggplot2**), thanks to the `add_ggplot()` function (think of it like the `+` operator in **ggplot2**). 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
plotdap(crs = "+proj=robin") %>%
  add_tabledap(sardines, ~subsample_count, size = 1) %>%
  add_ggplot(
    labs(
      subtitle = "Sardinops sagax samples",
      caption = "Sardines are yummy"
    ), 
    if (require(hrbrthemes)) hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum(),
    theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(), axis.text = element_blank())
  )
```
