`rerddap` is a general purpose R client for working with ERDDAP servers.

## Installation

From CRAN

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rerddap")
```

Or development version from GitHub

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ropensci/rerddap")
```

```{r}
library('rerddap')
```

## Background

ERDDAP is a server built on top of OPenDAP, which serves some NOAA data. You can get gridded data ([griddap](http://upwell.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/documentation.html)), which lets you query from gridded datasets, or table data ([tabledap](http://upwell.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/documentation.html)) which lets you query from tabular datasets. In terms of how we interface with them, there are similarties, but some differences too. We try to make a similar interface to both data types in `rerddap`.

## netCDF

`rerddap` supports netCDF format, and is the default when using the `griddap()` function. netCDF is a binary file format, and will have a much smaller footprint on your disk than csv. The binary file format means it's harder to inspect, but the `ncdf` and `ncdf4` packages make it easy to pull data out and write data back into a netCDF file. Note the the file extension for netCDF files is `.nc`. Whether you choose netCDF or csv for small files won't make much of a difference, but will with large files.

## Caching

Data files downloaded are cached in a single hidden directory `~/.rerddap` on your machine. It's hidden so that you don't accidentally delete the data, but you can still easily delete the data if you like.

When you use `griddap()` or `tabledap()` functions, we construct a MD5 hash from the base URL, and any query parameters - this way each query is separately cached. Once we have the hash, we look in `~/.rerddap` for a matching hash. If there's a match we use that file on disk - if no match, we make a http request for the data to the ERDDAP server you specify.

## ERDDAP servers

You can get a data.frame of ERDDAP servers using the function `servers()`. Most I think serve some kind of NOAA data, but there are a few that aren't NOAA data.  If you know of more ERDDAP servers, send a pull request, or let us know.

## Search

First, you likely want to search for data, specify either `griddadp` or `tabledap`

```{r ed_search_table}
ed_search(query = 'size', which = "table")
```

```{r ed_search_grid}
ed_search(query = 'size', which = "grid")
```

## Information

Then you can get information on a single dataset

```{r}
info('whoi_62d0_9d64_c8ff')
```

## griddap (gridded) data

```{r}
(out <- info('noaa_esrl_027d_0fb5_5d38'))
```

```{r griddap_data}
(res <- griddap(out,
  time = c('2012-01-01', '2012-01-12'),
  latitude = c(21, 20),
  longitude = c(-80, -79)
))
```

## tabledap (tabular) data

```{r tabledap_info}
(out <- info('erdCalCOFIfshsiz'))
```

```{r tabledap_data}
tabledap(out, fields = c('longitude', 'latitude', 'fish_size', 'itis_tsn'),
         'time>=2001-07-07', 'time<=2001-07-10')
```
