#' @param datasetx Anything coercable to an object of class info. So the output of a
#' call to \code{\link{info}}, or a datasetid, which will internally be passed
#' through \code{\link{info}}
#' @param ... Dimension arguments. See examples. Can be any 1 or more of the
#' dimensions for the particular dataset - and the dimensions vary by dataset.
#' For each dimension, pass in a vector of length two, with min and max value
#' desired. at least 1 required.
#' @param fields (character) Fields to return, in a character vector.
#' @param stride (integer) How many values to get. 1 = get every value, 2 = get
#' every other value, etc. Default: 1 (i.e., get every value)
#' @param fmt (character) One of csv or nc (for netcdf). Default: nc
#' @param url A URL for an ERDDAP server. Default:
#' https://upwell.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/ - See [eurl()] for 
#' more information
#' @param store One of \code{\link{disk}} (default) or \code{\link{memory}}. You
#' can pass options to \code{\link{disk}}. Beware: if you choose \code{fmt="nc"},
#' we force \code{store=disk()} because nc files have to be written to disk.
#' @param read (logical) Read data into memory or not. Does not apply when
#' \code{store} parameter is set to memory (which reads data into memory).
#' For large csv, or especially netcdf files, you may want to set this to
#' \code{FALSE}, which simply returns a summary of the dataset - and you can
#' read in data piecemeal later. Default: \code{TRUE}
#' @param callopts Curl options passed on to \code{\link[crul]{verb-GET}}
#'
#' @return An object of class \code{griddap_csv} if csv chosen or
#' \code{griddap_nc} if nc file format chosen. 
#' 
#' \itemize{
#'  \item \code{griddap_csv}: a data.frame created from the downloaded csv 
#'  data
#'  \item \code{griddap_nc}: a list, with slots "summary" and "data". "summary"
#'  is the unclassed output from \code{ncdf4::nc_open}, from which you can 
#'  do any netcdf operations you like. "data" is a data.frame created 
#'  from the netcdf data. the data.frame may be empty if there were problems
#'  parsing the netcdf data
#' }
#' 
#' Both have the attributes: datasetid (the dataset id), path (the path on file
#' for the csv or nc file), url (the url requested to the ERDDAP server)
#' 
#' If \code{read=FALSE}, the data.frame for \code{griddap_csv}
#' and the data.frame in the "data" slot is empty for \code{griddap_nc}
#'
#' @details Details:
#'
#' If you run into an error like "HTTP Status 500 - There was a (temporary?)
#' problem. Wait a minute, then try again.". it's likely they are hitting
#' up against a size limit, and they should reduce the amount of data they
#' are requesting either via space, time, or variables. Pass in
#' \code{config = verbose()} to the request, and paste the URL into your
#' browser to see if the output is garbled to examine if there's a problem
#' with servers or this package
#'
#' @section Dimensions and Variables:
#' ERDDAP grid dap data has this concept of dimenions vs. variables. Dimensions
#' are things like time, latitude, longitude, altitude, and depth. Whereas
#' variables are the measured variables, e.g., temperature, salinity, air.
#'
#' You can't separately adjust values for dimensions for different variables.
#' So, here's how it's gonna work:
#'
#' Pass in lower and upper limits you want for each dimension as a vector
#' (e.g., \code{c(1,2)}), or leave to defaults (i.e., don't pass anything to
#' a dimension). Then pick which variables you want returned via the
#' \code{fields} parameter. If you don't pass in options to the \code{fields}
#' parameter, you get all variables back.
#'
#' To get the dimensions and variables, along with other metadata for a
#' dataset, run \code{\link{info}}, and each will be shown, with their min
#' and max values, and some other metadata.
#'
#' @section Where does the data go?:
#' You can choose where data is stored. Be careful though. You can easily get a
#' single file of hundreds of MB's (upper limit: 2 GB) in size with a single
#' request. To the \code{store} parameter, pass \code{\link{memory}} if you
#' want to store the data in memory (saved as a data.frame), or pass
#' \code{\link{disk}} if you want to store on disk in a file. Note that
#' \code{\link{memory}} and \code{\link{disk}} are not character strings, but
#' function calls. \code{\link{memory}} does not accept any inputs, while
#' \code{\link{disk}} does. Possibly will add other options, like
#' \dQuote{sql} for storing in a SQL database.
#' 
#' @section Non-lat/lon grid data:
#' Some gridded datasets have latitude/longitude components, but some do not. 
#' When nc format gridded datasets have latitude and longitude we "melt" them into a 
#' data.frame for easy downstream consumption. When nc format gridded datasets do 
#' not have latitude and longitude components, we do not read in the data, throw
#' a warning saying so. You can readin the nc file yourself with the file path. 
#' CSV format is not affected by this issue as CSV data is easily turned into 
#' a data.frame regardless of whether latitude/longitude data are present.
